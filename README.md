**What is this?**

This repository contains most code I wrote during my intro to computer science class.
this happened during October - February 2021, so note this is fairly old and using older java versions.

Folders that start with mmn contain the 5 different assignment given throughout the semester with my code solution
as well as a lot of test files made by fellow students, teachers and some myself.
The testers usually have "test" in their name, while my code files don't.


files in the finalPractive folder are the programs I wrote when practiving to the finals, 
I first wrote them in the .txt format (those files are here as well) and later ran tests to make sure they work.
files named "question1.txt" and "question2.txt" are my answers that were written during the final for the 2 coding questions.


Final grading for all the assignments and for the final's code is 100/100.

Testers and some classes were written by the teachers and students, credit for those are in comments throughout the files
